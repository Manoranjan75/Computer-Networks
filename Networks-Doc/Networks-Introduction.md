# What is a Network?

A **network** refers to a system of interconnected elements that are linked together in order to share resources, exchange information, and services.  

During sharing in networks, it is important to follow rules that we call **“Protocol”** to ensure proper sharing (e.g., messages should reach the receiver in the same order and at the same time).  

To implement these protocols, the **International Organization for Standardization (ISO)** in **1984** developed the **OSI model (Open System Interconnection)**.

## Layer of OSI Model

---

## 1. Connection Types

- **Point-to-Point**  
  Direct link between 2 devices.  
  *Example:* Computer via telephone line, Remote → TV.  

- **Multipoint**  
  Link shared among many devices (space or time shared).  
  *Example:* Bus topology in LAN.

## 2. Transmission

**Definition:** Method of transferring data between devices across a network.  
Ensures communication by defining the **direction of data flow**.  

### Transmission Modes

- **Simplex**  
  - One-way communication only.  
  - Used when feedback is not required.  
  - *Example:* Keyboard → Computer, TV broadcast.  

- **Half Duplex**  
  - Both devices can send and receive, but only one at a time.  
  - Saves cost, but communication is slower than full duplex.  
  - *Example:* Walkie-talkies, Police radio.  

- **Full Duplex**  
  - Devices can send and receive data at the same time.  
  - Increases efficiency, requires better hardware.  
  - *Example:* Telephone calls, Zoom/WhatsApp calls.  

**Q:** Physical path over which a message travels → **Medium**

## 3. Transmission Media

- **Definition:** Medium that carries data signals from one device to another.  
- **Function:** Transfers data in **LANs and WANs**.  

### Types:
- **Guided (Wired)** → Physical cables like *Twisted Pair, Coaxial, Fiber Optic*.  
- **Unguided (Wireless)** → Uses air as medium: *Radio waves, Microwaves, Infrared*.

## 4. Guided Media (Wired Communication)

### (a) Twisted Pair Cable
- Made of two copper wires twisted in a helix form to reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI).  
- Cheap, lightweight, and easy to install, but limited bandwidth.  
- *Examples:* Home internet cables, office LANs.  

---


### (b) Coaxial Cable
- Contains a central copper core, insulating layer, and metallic shield to prevent EMI.  
- Supports high-frequency signals and provides better performance than twisted pair.  

**Advantages:**  
- High bandwidth  
- Better shielding  
- Reliable  

**Disadvantages:**  
- More expensive  
- Single cable fault can crash the entire network  

*Examples:* Cable TV connections, CCTV wiring.  

---

### (c) Fiber Optic Cable
- Uses **light pulses** to transmit data at very high speed.  
- Immune to electromagnetic interference and supports long-distance communication.  

**Advantages:**  
- Very high speed  
- Huge bandwidth  
- Works over long distances  

**Disadvantages:**  
- Expensive  
- Delicate  
- Difficult to install/maintain  

*Examples:* Internet backbone, submarine cables, **Jio Fiber / Airtel Xstream** broadband.
